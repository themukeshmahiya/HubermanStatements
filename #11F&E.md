 ## food -> amino acids -> neuromodulators.
  # Basics
     1. Chemicals in brain made from amino acids 
     2. parkisons is a depleion of dopamine neourone in brain 
     3. Dopamine is a derivative of the amino acid tyrosine (l-tyrosine)
     4. there is all over sensors in our gut that analysize the contents 
        of our food that we intake 
     5. vagus nerve is a brain body connection it collects info about
        lot of things brathing and heart rate things and that happens
        in gut and collect data about our food and send all info to brain 
     6. L-tyrosine contained food help us to level of dopamine in food 
        and want more to eat also feels motivated after eating that food
     7. the neouromodulators we get from food and get from brain are diffent 
        and only brain's are make chabges in our mood not that are in our gut.
        all this is because of Blood Brain Bariar
  # [Serotonin](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/serotonin)
     1. it makes us very comfortable and kinda bliss out where we are 
        but dopamine and epineprin makes us to pursuit of things or motivate 
        us to do things.
     2. carbohydrades increase the serotonin so it will help to sleep so 
        include in dinner not in breakfast or launch
     3. serotonin relese in the later part of night sleep in rem sleep 
     4. serotonin overflow in our body is a reason of reduced appetite
 # Omega
    1. Omega-3 can help us to create a better mood act as antideoress effect.
    2. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is one of several omega-3 fatty acids.
    3. EPA injection increase the Heart rate variablity(HRV).
    4. HRV makes omega-3/omega-6 ratio greater and this thing(ratio) 
       reduce depression and make little amount of antidepression suppliments  
       show large impact or more effective

  # microbiota
     1. fregmented foods is really helpful to maintain a good level of 
        healthy amount of good gut microbiota.
     2. yogurt is a good fregmented food
     3. gut microbiom also effected by many other things like exercise and other
        daily activities 
     4. fasting for long term reduce the amount of good bactiria in our gut 
        because we consume them when nothing to have eat but it also remove  
        bad ones so if we got more bad ones then we should fast longer 
     5. after fasting we should gradually start eating not just get full of 
        gut of so many foods because now our body will react differently to 
        the same food we were eating before fasting
