# Understanding & Treating Addiction : #33

*  if we expose ourselves chronically to substances or behaviors
   that repeatedly release large amounts of dopamine in our brains reward pathway,
   that we can change our tonic baseline and actually lower it over time,
   as our brain tries to compensate for all of that dopamine, which is more 
   really than we were designed to experience.

* the more you get dopamine from addictive sources the more you feel pain after the source removed and brain also reduce the release of dopamine due to dopamne flood we have and that will result into lower base line of dopamine as the result 

* it's the chronic use of dopamine boosters that can then reset 
  really our dopamine thresholds,and then nothing is enjoyable

* if I just wait for that feeling to pass, after getting a dopamine spike from anything then my dopamine will re-regulate itself
and I'll go back to whatever my chronic baseline is. But if I don't wait, and here's really the key, if I keep indulging again and again and again,
ultimately I have so much on the pain side, right,
that I've essentially reset my brain to what we call like an anhedonic, or lacking in joy type of state,
which is a dopamine-deficit state. So that's really the way in which pain can become
the main driver, is because I've indulged so much in these high reward behaviors or substances,that my brain has had to compensate by way down-regulating my own dopamine, such that even when I'm not doing that drug,
I'm in a dopamine deficit state, which is akin to a clinical depression

* once you've been addicted to a substance, severely addicted, that makes you more vulnerable to addiction
to any substance

* being awake and alert to your environment,
and connecting with your environment, not trying to escape it. And of course escapism is what we all want and desire,
that experience of non being. And we get it from the internet or from drugs or whatever it is, but it's the booby prize.
Because ultimately it takes you further and further away from your immediate environment,

* to become un-addicted, 30 days of zero interaction with that substance,the average amount of time it takes for the brain to reset reward pathways for dopamine transmission to regenerate itself.

* So again, this idea that by depriving ourselves
of this high dopamine high reward substance or behavior, we allow our brains to regenerate its own dopamine,
for the balance to really equilibrate. And then we're in a place where we can sort of enjoy other things. 
* sometimes thinking about the thing we got addicted to can be release mini spike of dopamine and that spick leads us to relapse so do another things to avoid this to happen.

* when we tell the truth, we actually potentially strengthen
our prefrontal cortical circuits, and their connections to our limbic brain and our reward brain.
And of course, these are the circuits that get disconnected when we're in our addiction
