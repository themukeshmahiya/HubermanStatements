# Emotions

* People who are constantly being yanked around by the external happenings in the world, you would say are emotionally labile(not stable)

* if you want to be effective in the world, it is useful when in very dynamic environments,
especially social environments, to have a lot of your attention focused outward not inward. 

* as opposed to trying to pay attention to whether or not you're 
  saying things correctly or the tambour of your own voice(inward),
  that is more or less destructive for the ability to engage socially. 

* it is hard to do fully exterocepive attension but easy to do for interoceptive.

* he general theme is that oxytocin is promoting monogamy,
  it's promoting pair bonding, it's promoting a understanding 
  of the internal state of others,which requires enhanced  
  exteroception for those particular others

* So not just generally having them look everywhere
  and see what's going on in the world, but particularly
  paying attention to the emotional states of others.

* vitamin D and melatonin have positive effect on release of oxytocin
