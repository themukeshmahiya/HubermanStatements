  increased dopamine levels in animals and humans
* getting increases in dopamine that are going to promote
  the production of testosterone and estrogen to healthy levels
* if you're viewing bright light in the middle of the night, you are suppressing dopamine     release, if you're suppressing dopamine release,
you are suppressing testosterone levels so much so that I would wager that a major effect of sleep deprivation
* ice baths and cold showers can have positive effects on the sex 
   steroid hormones, both testosterone, mainly in males,
